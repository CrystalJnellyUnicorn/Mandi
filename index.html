 My first day in primary at the CopperFeild ward, I was 6. I had no one to talk to. I had nothing to say. I sat alone. The seat next to me was empty. You said: "I want to sit next to the new kid!" So you sat next to me, and started talking to me. I started talking back. After primary we sat next to each other in class, and talked even more. That's how I knew we would have a life long friendship. So thank you for being the one that made church fun! HAPPY BIRTHDAY MANDI!!!!!!<br>
 Now, I will put a collage of cute cats and dogs.
